    <h3 class="headr">Shambare, Rugimbana & Zhowa</h3>
    <p class="aboutr">Shambare, Rugimbana & Zhowa (2012) claimed that cell phones are "possibly the biggest non-drug addiction of the 21st century", and that college students may spend up to nine hours every day on their phones, which can lead to dependence on such technologies as a driver of modern life and an example of "a paradox of technology" that is both freeing and enslaving</p>
    <h3 class="headr">Securenovy survey</h3>
    <p class="aboutr">A survey conducted by SecurEnvoy showed that young adults and adolescents are more likely to have nomophobia. The same survey reported that 77% of the teens reported anxiety and worries when they were without their mobile phones, followed by the 25-34 age group and people over 55 years old. Some psychological predictors to look for in a person who might have this phobia are "self negative views, younger age, low esteem and self-efficacy, high extroversion or introversion, impulsiveness and sense of urgency and sensation seeking"</p>
    <h3 class="headr">Other experiment</h3>
    <p class="aboutr">
        The study, encompassing 946 adolescents and emerging adults aged 15 to 24 in Australia, delved into the nexus between mobile phone use frequency and psychological attachment. Employing tools like the Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire (MPIQ), it explored behavioral addictions alongside psychological aspects like self-identity and validation from others. Results revealed a moderate correlation between mobile phone usage and psychological attachment, with no pathological conditions evident but signs of excessive use hinting at attachment issues. Notably, participants displaying heightened mobile phone use tended to escalate their usage when receiving validation from peers. Given the target demographic's transitional phase of self-identity, self-esteem, and social identity development, the study suggests a susceptibility to mobile phone dependency</p>
